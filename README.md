## Portfolio Contents

Due to my work in proprietary environments, I cannot share what I have made in the field, however I have recreated the average document I would work on so you can have a general idea of my skillset!

| Document | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **API Reference Guide** | A structured guide detailing fictional API endpoints, parameters, responses, and use cases. Demonstrates precision, consistency, and understanding of developer-facing content. |
| **System Overview + Integration Guide** | A fictional system created to demonstrate my ability to explain architecture, workflows, and integration steps for a software environment. |
